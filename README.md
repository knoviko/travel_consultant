The final qualification work was carried out on the topic: «Intelligent Travel Consultant with Big Data Support».
The aim of the work was to create a recommendation system «Intelligent Travel Consultant with Big Data Support». During  the work, the tasks of the final qualification work and the requirements for the developed system were formulated.
Based on a review of existing software implementations and strategies for creating recommendation systems, the main algorithms and software tools for practical implementation of the recommendation system were identified.
A web interface was developed, the steps of creating a database were described. Due to the lack of ready-made algorithms in the literature that implement the collaborative filtering method for the given system functioning conditions, a proprietary algorithm for collaborative filtering using the proprietary hybrid modified Euclidean-Hamming method was developed.
The data processing method used allows the use of a recommendation system with Big Data sets.
The system was implemented programmatically using software selected as a result of the analysis. Conducted computational experiments have proven the efficiency and effectiveness of the created recommendation system «Intelligent Travel Consultant with Big Data Support».
